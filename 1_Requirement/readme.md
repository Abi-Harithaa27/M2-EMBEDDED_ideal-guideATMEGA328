# Requirements
  ## Introduction
The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container.Hence automating this system will help us to reduce the wastage of water resources.This helps the user to monitor the level of water in the tank and save this high demand renewable resouurce with ease. 
 This will also help in Industries where water is majorly used and the wastage is also high. This project is designed to help people save water and to keep a track on the level of water in the tank and prevent over flowing.
  
  ## Features
  One of the most important feature of this project is that , it displays the level of water in the LCD display. This helps in preventing the overflow of the water. This also intimates us whether the water is to be filled or not in a tank. Since the product is fully automated, its cutsoff automataically when the tank is fully filled. All these make the product user friendly and prevents overflow of water tanks.<br />
  Easy installation, Low maintenance , Compact elegant design ,The Automatic water level controller ensures no overflows or dry running of pump there by saves electricity and water.Avoid seepage of roofs and walls due to overflowing tanks.Fully automatic, saves man power,Consume very little energy, ideal for continuous operation.
Automatic water level controller provides you the flexibility to decide for yourself the water levels for operations of pump set.Shows clear indication of water levels in the overhead tank.

 ## SWOT ANALYSIS
  ### Strengths
 1.Water is conserved which is a high time need. <br /> 
 2.Manual work is reduced.
   ### Weakness
High Maintance is required since water is the major element.
  ### Opportunities
The data displayed as output can be transmitted to the user through various methodolgies and the code also can be easily modified.
  ### Threats

New and different versions of this product is available. Easily modifiable.
 ## 4W's and 1H
  ### Who
This Product can be used by the customer since it is user friendly and help to monitor the water level.
  ### What

It helps to fill the waterand automatically cut off when is reaches the level. This helps to monitor the level of water and prevents wastage.
  ### When

Whenever the level of the water is Low , this helps us to fill the water automatically and cutsoff whe the level is high or full. 
  ### Where

This sysstem can be used in places where the level of the water needs to be monitored.
  ### How

The system controled by atmega328 which gives commands to the system.
